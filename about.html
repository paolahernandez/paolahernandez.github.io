		<h1> About Me! </h1>
			<img style="float:left;height:25%;width:25%;" src="images/gradph2.png">
				<p>My name is Paola Hernandez. I am an 18 year old Computer Science major at URI. I am currently a commuter but I hope to reside on campus in the near future. 
                    My goal after getting my bachelors in Computer Science is to be a fullstack for a company like Apple. I would also be really interested in
            being a software developer or computer programmer for NASA. I am very into sports and enjoy a good workout. I am a three sport athlete and hope on
            playing for URI. I play soccer, basketball, and run track. When I am not playing sports I am either working or hanging with my family. My hobbies consist
            of singing, writing/playing music, or trying new food places!</p>
